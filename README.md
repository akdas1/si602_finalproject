# si602_finalproject

## Dataset Description

The data for this project was retrieved and uploaded to this repository from the Kaggle dataset called, "Popular Video Games 1980 - 2023 ðŸŽ®" by user Randomarnab. You can find the Kaggle page linked here: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023)

This respository is meant for storing external data I have recieved from Kaggle dataset above, to satisfy ease of access requirements while submitting my final project for SI 602. It will not contain the respective jupyter notebooks I have completed, but a repository enables ease of access to the data without download and file import. This is only meant to make importing easier for the teaching team and peer reviewers.
