## Project Details
The academic project primarily focuses on posterior probability, expectations, and distributions to analyze a video game scenario. The project goal was to showcase what I learned in a mock-lesson setting. More details are uploaded within the Jupyter notebook.

This project used **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** to plot a bonus sample solution displaying the Probability and Cumulative Distribution Functions (PDF and CDFs) for a given genre's rating probability.

The [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/2.2/) library was used for storing genre ratings and probabilities within arrays.

The [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) library for plotting the probability distribution functions from arrays.
